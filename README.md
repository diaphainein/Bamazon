### Overview

Well, I don't have screenshots or a video because I couldn't get it to work.
I was pretty sick this week and it was a miracle I even got this done.

This will be updated if there's any possible room to get help before it's due; Saturday's pretty packed.
I'll stay after if I can't get help before it's due and will update the repository with the requisite video if I can get it working, but feel free not to count that since it would technically be late at that point.

It will connect and speak with the database, but it won't read the data inside of it. It's very strange. 
I can't figure out why it's doing this.
Only I would have this problem.
