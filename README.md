### Overview

Well, I don't have screenshots or a video because I couldn't get it to work.
I was pretty sick this week and it was a miracle I even got this done.

This will be updated if there's any possible room to get help before it's due; Saturday's pretty packed.
I'll stay after if I can't get help before it's due and will update the repository with the requisite video if I can get it working, but feel free not to count that since it would technically be late at that point.

It will connect and speak with the database, but it won't read the data inside of it. It's very strange. 
I can't figure out why it's doing this.
Only I would have this problem.

### I fixed it! ...sort of

I have screenshots! I figured out why it wasn't working and have updated the files in the repository.
I wrote my code before I created my database, and the placeholders I was using didn't match up with the column names in the database. Whoops.
I make idiot mistakes. :)
Got it working, then something else happened (documented in screenshots) with an unfulfilled promise. Also probably something easy and silly.
